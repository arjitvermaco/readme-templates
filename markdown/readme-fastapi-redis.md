##  Overview

The async-ml-inference project offers a comprehensive solution for asynchronous machine learning inference operations. Through a Dockerized environment, it orchestrates services for API, backend, audio, and Euro tasks using Celery, FastAPI, and related technologies. The project's core functionalities include handling audio length extraction, Euro millions results scraping, and managing ML model inference tasks efficiently. By structuring tasks as background processes, the project optimizes performance and scalability while ensuring real-time monitoring and result handling capabilities. Overall, async-ml-inference simplifies asynchronous ML inference workflows, streamlining the deployment and execution of complex machine learning tasks.
